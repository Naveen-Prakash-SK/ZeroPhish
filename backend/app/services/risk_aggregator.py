"""
PhishGuard AI — Risk Aggregator
Centralized risk scoring that combines ML probability, URL indicators,
content indicators, and behavioral indicators into a final risk assessment.

Uses adaptive weight profiles (URL mode vs message mode) to avoid
penalizing scans where certain channels are not applicable.
Applies a corroboration boost when multiple independent channels
converge on high-risk signals.
